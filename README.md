# Call4Needs 

The Call4Needs team focused on addressing the mental health and safety concerns of young women navigating public spaces alone. Our project began with conducting needfinding, followed by the development of low- and high-fidelity prototypes, heuristic evaluation, usability tests, and user studies for our SheShield app.
