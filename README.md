# Call4Needs 

Centered on health and well-being theme, the Call4Needs team focused on addressing the mental health and safety concerns of young women navigating public spaces alone. Our project involved conducting needfinding, developing low- and high-fidelity prototypes, performing heuristic evaluation, usability tests, and conducting user studies for our SheShield app.
